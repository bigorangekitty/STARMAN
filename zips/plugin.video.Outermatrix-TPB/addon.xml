    <description lang="en">Ricky and Julian are two guys whose lives were shaped by their experiences growing up in the Trailer Park. Their childhood was typical of most trailer park kids - stealing, fighting, smoking, drinking, scamming and listening to Van Halen. The Boys have had their share of trouble with the law and spend a large portion of their adult lives behind bars.
Made in Canada, Enjoy!</description>
